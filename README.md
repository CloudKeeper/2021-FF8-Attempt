Picked up the old half finished pose system and finished that.
The pose, pose/reset and pose/default lead to some trickyness defining the 
target. Wasn't as neat as I would like it to be but it should work. Will do
a testing phase later which may encourage me to refactor it with fresh eyes.

Picking this back up after the last time I put it down.

On first review:
-The ambience system seems to be functional and connected up to rooms only.
 Will need to connect up to objects and characters in future
-The detail system seems to be functional and connected up to rooms and 
 commands.
-Everything else does not to be in a complete state. Will review as needed.

The next thing I'm going to work on is a pose/emote system.
