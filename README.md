Picking this back up after the last time I put it down.

On first review:
-The ambience system seems to be functional and connected up to rooms only.
 Will need to connect up to objects and characters in future
-The detail system seems to be functional and connected up to rooms and 
 commands.
-Everything else does not to be in a complete state. Will review as needed.

The next thing I'm going to work on is a pose/emote system.
